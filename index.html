<h1>Where has coding been my whole life?</h1>
<p> I honestly feel like a kid who has been given a set of LEGO (a kid who likes LEGO, this metaphor wouldn’t be applicable to a kid who doesn’t) where it is possible to build just about anything. </p>
<p>I look and see that there is so so so much to learn but rather than being overwhelming, it’s enticing and reels me in even further.</p>
<p>I know I am only just starting to scratch the surface but the more I learn, the more I fall in love with it and want to learn even more. </p>
<p>Please feel free to have a look around and make sure to stay out of the Don’t Click Here section. I would be absolutely mortified if someone got in there. </p>
