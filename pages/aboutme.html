    <div class="grid-item1"><h1>About Me</h1>
      <p> Born in Brazil in 1988 (yes, I have a few greys in my beard), moved to Australia in 2009. Since then, I have worked as a building/facilities manager where I have gained many skills. However, I am hardly passionate about the area. <br>
<br>
        Despite having completed a Bachelor of Information Technology over 10 years (2012), the closest I got to coding during the course was a little basic Assembly. 
        Recently, my interest in gaming has led me to wonder how games are made. In turn, it has opened my horizons to a whole new area which I just canâ€™t get enough of: the logic, the functionality, the possibilities and even the high of fixing a persistent bug. I've read somewhere that <i>"coding is art that does something"</i> and I couldn't agree more. <br> <br>
        Coding and developing are, without the slightest hint of doubt,  what I to learn, talk about and breathe everyday.</p>
