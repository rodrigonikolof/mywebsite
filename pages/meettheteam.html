      <p><u><b>Cora</b></u><br>
        <i>Position: The Manager</i> <br>
        As suggested by the title, manages activities and attempts to coordinate general household operations such as where people should sit, what foods to make, and where items should go. 
        Often willing to provide unsolicited assistance to other household members. Though it must be noted that tasks where assistance is provided have a very low completion rate or tend to take 3x longer when in fact completed. 
        Her skill to avoid lava on the ground is second to none.

        Thinks Star Wars is the best movie setting but The Matrix is the best movie. Loves Naruto  anime but dislikes Naruto the main character. 
        Very competent drummer, incompetent guitarist, traumatising singer. 
        Does not play Xbox as well as he thinks he does.
